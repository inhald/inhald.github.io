    Hi! I'm a Mechatronics Engineering student at McMaster University interested in Robot Learning. I am currently supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xQDmZcAAAAAJ&hl=en"> Dr. Stephen Kelly </a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=TWcYp5sAAAAJ&hl=en"> Dr. Matthew Giamou. </a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously, I worked on autonomous systems under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9KcS4cMAAAAJ&hl=en"> Dr. Shahin Sirouspour,</a> and developed autonomous navigation system for scaled vehicles, by fusing LiDAR and depth data to generate SVM-like virtual barriers which execute collision-free path planning. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I am currently seeking internships with academic or industry research labs for Fall 2025.
